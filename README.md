# API Docs
To generate new docs with the swagger-ui any route needs to have this comment scheme 
```
/**
 * Adds two numbers.
 * @param {number} a - The first number.
 * @param {number} b - The second number.
 * @returns {number} The sum of the two numbers.
 */
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
After adding comments to your code, you can run the jsdoc command to generate the documentation
